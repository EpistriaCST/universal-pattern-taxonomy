## Overview

This repository contains the reference implementation of the **Universal Pattern Taxonomy** â€” a framework for navigating patterns across domains through a 9-dimensional coordinate system.  

The project is part of a larger initiative called **Pattern Engineering**, which is documented in two complementary works:

- **The Pattern Synthesis: A Historical Framework for Knowledge Evolution** (the *why*)  
- **Universal Pattern Taxonomy: Architecture and Implementation** (the *how*)  

Together, these establish both the intellectual case and the technical machinery for a new discipline of cross-domain pattern discovery.
